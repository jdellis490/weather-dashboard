# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The motivaiton behind this project was to improve my use of APIs and fetch request syntax while also building something useful. The project was built to apply current knowledge of using fetch requets by looking at the different forms of documentation for the API used from OpenWeather. This project solves the question of what the weather conditions and temperature of different cities across the country. I learned that one must make a fetch request using a different URL each time for different data within the API, so attention to the documentation is critical.

## Usage
